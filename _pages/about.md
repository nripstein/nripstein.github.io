I'm an incoming Statistics PhD student at the University of Toronto. My research involves developing statistical methodology, computational techniques, and accessible software to solve data-centric challenges in science and healthcare. I've enjoyed working on Bayesian computation, hierarchical models, and spatial statistics.

I completed my undergraduate degree in McMaster University's interdisciplinary "[Artsci](https://artsci.mcmaster.ca/)" program, with combined honours in Psychology, Neuroscience and Behaviour, and a Math minor. I developed my deep interest in Statistics through computational neuroscience research, where I studied the "Bayesian brain hypothesis," and worked on statistical models of human sensory perception and learning. 

In my free time, I like to hike, canoe, play chess, and follow the stock market.
